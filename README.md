Simple Python Calculator

Welcome to the Simple Python Calculator!  This is a straightforward and easy-to-use command-line calculator built with Python. It's designed to let you perform basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus (remainder), all with a simple menu interface.

Why This Project Exists

This calculator was created with two main goals:

To learn and practice Python: It's a fun and simple project for Python beginners to get comfortable with basic concepts like user input, loops, conditionals, and error handling.

To provide a no-frills, lightweight calculator: Sometimes, you just need to do some quick math without the hassle of opening a full calculator app. This tool gives you just what you need in a simple, accessible way.

Features

Simple Arithmetic: Perform the basic operations you need: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

Input Validation: The program ensures you only enter valid numbers and handles any errors gracefully (like trying to divide by zero).

Interactive Menu: The calculator presents you with a menu to choose from and prompts you for input in a friendly way.

Error Handling: If something goes wrong (like entering text instead of numbers), the program helps guide you to fix it.

How to Use the Calculator

Run the Calculator: Download or clone this project to your computer. Then, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where you saved the file. Run the calculator by typing a simple command (don’t worry, it’s easy!).

Choose an Operation: When you run the calculator, it will give you a menu with options like:

+ for addition

- for subtraction

* for multiplication

/ for division

% for modulus (remainder)

q to quit

Enter Your Numbers: The program will ask you for two numbers, and then it will perform the operation you've chosen and show the result.

Keep Calculating or Quit: You can continue performing calculations as much as you like, or type q to exit the program when you're done.

Why Use This Calculator?

Quick and Simple: No need to download a heavy app or open your phone’s calculator — just type a few commands in your terminal, and you're ready to go.

Great for Practice: Perfect for anyone learning Python or command-line tools, as it covers basic operations and error handling.
